# Refactoring

You've been asked to refactor the function `deterministicPartitionKey` in [`dpk.js`](dpk.js) to make it easier to read and understand without changing its functionality. For this task, you should:

1. Write unit tests to cover the existing functionality and ensure that your refactor doesn't break it. We typically use `jest`, but if you have another library you prefer, feel free to use it.
2. Refactor the function to be as "clean" and "readable" as possible. There are many valid ways to define those words - use your own personal definitions, but be prepared to defend them. Note that we do like to use the latest JS language features when applicable.
3. Write up a brief (~1 paragraph) explanation of why you made the choices you did and why specifically your version is more "readable" than the original.

You will be graded on the exhaustiveness and quality of your unit tests, the depth of your refactor, and the level of insight into your thought process provided by the written explanation.

## Your Explanation Here
The deterministicPartitionKey function has been refactored to improve readability, maintainability, and conciseness, while preserving the original functionality.

1. I removed the TRIVIAL_PARTITION_KEY constant and replaced it with a direct return value of "0". This simplifies the code and makes it more concise.
2. To comply with DRY (Don't repeat yourself) principle, I extracted the hashing process into a separate createHash function. This eliminates code repetition and improves readability.
3. I used the ternary operator to simplify the conditionals, leading to a more concise and easier-to-read code.
4. I preserved the original functionality by maintaining the same behavior when dealing with non-string partition keys.

By implementing these changes, the refactored function is more readable and maintainable, ensuring that the original functionality is preserved. The unit tests were created to cover the existing functionality, ensuring that the refactored function passes all test cases without breaking the original behavior going by the TDD (test driven development) pattern.
